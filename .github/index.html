    <h2> I Don't Get Enough Sleep.</h2>
    <h6> This is an about me page about the lack of sleep.</h6>
    <p>
      I am a sophmore in Staten Island Tech High School, and I would say my grades are decent. I think I can improve them if I was in a better mood or if I had more energy. I mostly go to sleep around 12 or 1 am. The lack of sleep is not something to be proud of. Getting good sleep is the key to success. I don't get enough sleep because of my irresponiblity. So I just want people to know. Get some sleep.

      <p>

      Here is a link to scare (kinda) you to sleep.
